# zillow

This program has two driver scripts, the first one "zil_rel" scrapes the initial realtor list for a given location and writes all the realtor names and links to their profile to an Excel file. 
The second script, "find_person" goes to that profile and prints a txt file with all the company info and all the realtors info.
"scrape_fun" contains helper functions that help both scripts.

Examples of the Excel file and the txt file are given for Moscow, ID. Note that I did not run for all possible realtors both because of time and access to Zillow, so this project still has work to do in terms of scaling.
